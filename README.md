gcpping is both a command line tool and a webapp that reports median latency to
Google Cloud regions. The webapp is hosted at [gcping.com](http://gcping.com).
To install the command line tool, see below.

Note: This is not an official Google product.

## CLI Usage

```
gcping [options...]

-n       Number of requests to be made to each region.
         By default 10; can't be negative.
-c       Max number of requests to be made at any time.
         By default 10; can't be negative or zero.
-r       Report latency for an individual region.
-t       Timeout. By default, no timeout.
         Examples: "500ms", "1s", "1s500ms".
